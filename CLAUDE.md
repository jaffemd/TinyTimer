## TestFlight Deployment Checklist
- ‚úÖ **App Configuration**: Bundle ID: `jaffemd.TinyTimer`, Version: 1.0, Build: 1
- ‚úÖ **Dark/Light Mode**: Fully tested with semantic colors (`.systemBackground`, `.systemGray5`, `.primary`)
- ‚úÖ **Build Success**: Project builds successfully with Xcode 16+ and iOS 18.5+ SDK
- ‚úÖ **Portrait Orientation**: App locked to portrait mode for toddler use
- ‚úÖ **Background Processing**: Timer continues when app backgrounded
- ‚úÖ **Audio Permissions**: Graceful handling of audio session management

**Next Steps for TestFlight:**
1. **Apple Developer Account**: Requires paid Apple Developer Program membership
2. **Archive & Upload**: Use Xcode ‚Üí Product ‚Üí Archive ‚Üí Distribute App ‚Üí App Store Connect
3. **App Store Connect**: Configure test information and beta app description
4. **Internal Testing**: Up to 100 team members (immediate availability)
5. **External Testing**: Up to 10,000 external testers (requires App Review approval)

## Dynamic Island & Notifications Debugging

**Current Issue**: Dynamic Island and push notifications not appearing despite enabled permissions.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Physical Device Required**: Dynamic Island features only work on iPhone 14 Pro/15 Pro+ physical devices, not simulators
2. **Widget Extension**: Live Activities require proper Widget Extension target (partially implemented with embedded widget bundle)
3. **API Fixes**: Fixed `areFrequentPushesEnabled` API error in `LiveActivityManager.swift:19`

**Implementation Status**:
- ‚úÖ **ActivityKit Integration**: `TimerActivityAttributes.swift` with Live Activity data structure
- ‚úÖ **LiveActivityManager**: Service with authorization checks and activity lifecycle management
- ‚úÖ **NotificationService**: Push notification scheduling with "Stop & Reset" actions
- ‚úÖ **Widget Bundle**: `TinyTimerWidgets` embedded in main app target for Live Activities
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Logging**: Console debugging output for Live Activity creation/updates
- ‚úÖ **Build Success**: All code compiles and builds successfully

**Testing Requirements**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Physical iPhone 14 Pro+**: Dynamic Island only visible on supported hardware
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **iOS 16.1+**: Live Activities minimum OS requirement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Notification Permissions**: User must grant notification permissions in iOS Settings

**Console Debugging Commands**:
```bash
# Check console output when testing Live Activities
xcrun simctl spawn booted log stream --predicate 'subsystem CONTAINS "TinyTimer"'
```
